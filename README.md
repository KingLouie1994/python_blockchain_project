# Python Blockchain Project

This project was part of a Python online course. During the course I learned a lot about the core concepts of Python and the Blockchain.

Within this project Python was used to built many aspects that make up a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. The result is a functioning blockchain with users who can send amounts to each other. Through hashes and proof of work, the blockchain is not modifiable or hackable.
