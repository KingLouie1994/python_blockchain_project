# Python Blockchain Project

The blockchain I built in this project is the final work of a Python course I participated in. The course included all the basics about Python, Flask and Blockchain.

The blockchain can create wallets consisting of public and private keys, mine blocks, perform transactions between users, display open transactions as well as previous blocks, and detect and prevent attacks on the blocks already created. All of these functions are enabled via a frontend built in Vue.js, which accesses a Flask backend.
